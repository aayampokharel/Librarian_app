1. Book Search: Users can search for books by entering the book's name. The app will then suggest the closest matching books from the library's collection.
2. Book Details: Upon selecting a book from the search results, users can view detailed information about the book, including its author, genre, publication date, and availability status.
3. Issued and Expiry Dates: The app displays the issued date when a user borrows a book and calculates the expiry date until which the user is allowed to keep the book. This feature helps both librarians and users keep track of borrowed books.
