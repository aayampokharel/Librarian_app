this is my first full-stack app. this is a simple library app that can be used by the librarian . For reference, i have took only 10 books and through ui user enters the 
<br>
book name for which the closest matching book suggestion is displayed. upon clicking it , and pressign the tick button on the search bar's right side, the other related data with the <br>
book will be displayed along with issued date and expiry date till when the user is allowed to take the book for. And i have also implemented the fine system where current time and expiry time are compared and resultant fine is displayed .
