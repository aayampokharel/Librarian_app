This full-stack application is designed to streamline the library borrowing process, providing librarians with efficient tools to manage book inventory and assist users in finding relevant titles. Below is a comprehensive guide on how to use and navigate through the app.

Features
Book Search: Users can search for books by entering the book's name. The app will then suggest the closest matching books from the library's collection.
Book Details: Upon selecting a book from the search results, users can view detailed information about the book, including its author, genre, publication date, and availability status.
Issued and Expiry Dates: The app displays the issued date when a user borrows a book and calculates the expiry date until which the user is allowed to keep the book. This feature helps both librarians and users keep track of borrowed books.
